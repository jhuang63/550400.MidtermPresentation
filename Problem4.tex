\section{Formulate the Problem} 
Is the tennis game fair? The problem as stated is unanswerable. A better approach would be to provide a explicit definition of the 'fair': whether being the receiver or not (for the first round), has not effect on the probability of winning the game. Thus we can try to determine how players perform when they are receivers or senders. As long as there exists a noticeable difference between being receiver and being sender, we could then conclude that the tennie game is not fair.

We have changed the original problem considerably. We are going to answer how players perform when they are receivers and senders. Actually then questions nedd further refinement. For example, different players have different strengths and weaknesses, and their strengths of being receivers will effect the research conclusion. The question how player perform as receiver contains a trap, because it invite us to ignore these variations.

\section{Outline the Model}
As we mentioned above, the prediction of population is now an urgent issueto tackle. To obtain a simple model, we need to ignore time lag effects; that is, we assume that only the present value of N and its derivatives are relevant in determining the future values of N. Let the exogenous variables be the net reproduction rate r per individual, the time t, and the size of the population at t=0. The model would certainly be useful if it fits the real world. For the further step, we gonna replace the net reproduction rate by a strictly decreasing function of N, and make robust prediction with few assumptions concerning the nature of the function r(N).  
The sponsor currently has a limited capability to conduct such statistical research and modeling with existing data, and our task is to provide them with a statistical conclusion with reasonable assumptions.
